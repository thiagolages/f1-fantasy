# f1-fantasy

Repo to calculate the best solution for your F1 Fantasuu Team. 

## How to use

1. You should input your F1 qualy and race predictions in the corresponding .txt files, with the order of which you think drivers will finish on each day.
2. Also, if there's a sprint race in that weekend, you should change the 'sprint' variable to True and also fill in the sprint.txt file.
3. Finally, you should fill in the cost for each driver/constructor, in millions of dollars (in F1 Fantasy)
4. The code considers the teams and driver's cost and finds the best overall solution for setting up your F1 Fantasy team, considering the $100M cap and exactly 5 drivers + 1 constructor.
